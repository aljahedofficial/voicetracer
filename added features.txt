VoiceTracer - Added Features Plan (Core 8 Metrics)

Goal
- Expand from 4 metrics to the Core 8 for 70-90% AI detection without LLMs.
- Keep runtime lightweight for Streamlit.

Phases

Phase 1 - Metric Foundations (logic and lexicons)
- Add lexicons: function words, discourse markers, hedging terms, confidence markers.
- Add metric definitions + normalization rules in metrics_spec.
- Implement calculations in metric_calculator using existing tokenization.
Deliverable: 4 new metric calculators returning normalized scores and raw values.

Phase 2 - Data Models and Engine Integration
- Extend MetricScores and MetricDeltas with 4 new fields.
- Update MetricCalculationEngine and MetricComparisonEngine.
- Update metadata, export schema, and benchmark placeholders.
Deliverable: end-to-end metrics available in analysis results.

Phase 3 - UI and Visuals
- Add 4 metric cards in Step 2.
- Update radar chart axes from 4 to 8.
- Update delta visualizations and narrative summaries.
Deliverable: Streamlit UI shows 8 metrics consistently.

Phase 4 - Exports and Documentation
- CSV/JSON/PDF tables updated with 8 metrics.
- Update README and docs to reflect Core 8.
Deliverable: all export formats include 8 metrics.

Phase 5 - Validation and Tuning
- Add tests for new metrics and edge cases (short texts, empty inputs).
- Adjust thresholds/normalization if needed based on manual samples.
Deliverable: test coverage + tuned ranges for stable output.

Implementation Notes
- No LLMs, no external corpora required.
- Use lexical lists + simple heuristics to keep dependencies minimal.
- Metrics added: Function Word Ratio, Discourse Marker Density, Information Density, Epistemic Hedging Index.
