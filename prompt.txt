4. Enhanced Metric Explanations ✅
Added for EACH metric:
                  * "What It Is" - Definition and formula
                  * "Why It Matters" - Educational and research context
                  * "Your Scores" - Original vs. edited comparison
                  * "Why It Changed" - Interpretation of differences
                  * "Recommendations" - Actionable suggestions
Example (Burstiness Index):
What It Is:
Measures sentence length variation (SD of lengths ÷ mean length)


Why It Matters:
- AI text has uniform lengths (low burstiness < 0.8)
- Human writing has natural variation (high burstiness > 1.5)
- Variation indicates authentic learner writing


Your Scores:
Original: 1.23 (Human-like)
Edited: 0.95 (Moderate)
Change: -0.28 (-22.8%)


Why It Changed:
AI editing standardized sentence lengths for clarity


Recommendation:
Restore some original sentence variety while keeping improvements
