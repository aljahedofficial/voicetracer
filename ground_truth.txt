At first, I get very limited amount of time to speak in the class. Though the class time is 45-60
minutes, most of the time I have to make the students practise written drills, not speaking. 20 to 30
minutes maybe the average time of my speaking that is in Bangla. My speaking solely focuses on
grammatical rules and vocabularies. Sometimes, I crack jokes to keep my students engaged and active
in my class. I hardly involve the students in speaking apart from answering some questions related to
grammatical rules. The speaking seems robotic. For example, when I ask a particular student: “What
could be the answer to this question?” He/she replies: “talks”. He/she does not explain why there is an
“s” at the end of “talk” until I prompt him/her. Again, due to class time limitation and classroom
controlling, I hardly involve my students in any “fatigue” talks and try to complete my lessons on
time. I think, in a classroom above 50 students, it is hard to follow the principles of “Teaching
Speaking” and the techniques as well. Because, the students are exam oriented. Actually, the whole
education system is exam oriented. So, any other techniques, apart from question-answer, may fail as
far as I think. Sometimes, there are students who are not willing too. Also, the class time allocation is
a great barrier. And from my part, I do lack the qualities to keep the attention of the students for 2
continuous hours. I have never done so either. Most of my classes end within 45 to 60 minutes. That’s
why, it will be hard for me to keep them focused on a particular topic for a long time. However, from
now on, I will try to follow the principles and techniques if my classes have students below 30 and
will note what went well or not.


Edited with AI:
At present, I am allotted a very limited amount of time to engage in spoken interaction during my classes. Although the total class duration ranges between 45 and 60 minutes, a significant portion of this time is dedicated to written drills rather than oral communication. On average, my own speaking time may be estimated at approximately 20 to 30 minutes, and this speaking is conducted primarily in Bangla. Furthermore, the focus of my spoken instruction is largely restricted to grammatical rules and vocabulary explanations. In order to maintain student attention and classroom engagement, I occasionally incorporate light humor; however, this strategy serves more as a supportive tool rather than as an integral pedagogical technique.

Student participation in speaking activities remains minimal. Apart from responding to direct questions related to grammar, students are rarely encouraged to engage in extended oral production. As a result, classroom speaking often appears mechanical and formulaic. For instance, when I ask a student, “What could be the answer to this question?”, the typical response may simply be “talks.” In such cases, the student does not elaborate on the grammatical rationale behind the addition of the suffix “-s” unless explicit prompting is provided. This pattern indicates a limited depth of communicative engagement.

Moreover, due to constraints related to time management and classroom control, I generally avoid initiating prolonged or exploratory discussions that may lead to fatigue or loss of structure. Instead, priority is given to completing the prescribed syllabus within the allotted time. In classrooms consisting of more than 50 students, implementing the principles and techniques associated with teaching speaking becomes particularly challenging. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that students are predominantly examination-oriented. In reality, the broader education system itself is structured around exam performance, which reduces the perceived effectiveness of communicative techniques beyond the traditional question-and-answer format.

Additionally, there are instances where students themselves demonstrate a lack of willingness to participate in speaking activities. Class time allocation therefore emerges as a major structural barrier. From a personal standpoint, I must also acknowledge that I currently lack certain instructional qualities required to sustain student attention for extended periods, such as two consecutive hours. In practice, I have never conducted classes of such duration, as most sessions conclude within 45 to 60 minutes. Consequently, maintaining focus on a single topic for a prolonged time remains difficult.

Nevertheless, moving forward, I intend to make a conscious effort to apply the principles and techniques of teaching speaking in classes with fewer than 30 students. During this process, I plan to systematically observe and record which strategies prove effective and which do not, in order to inform future instructional practices.
